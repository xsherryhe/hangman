This project is a program that allows a single player to play, save, and load a game of [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) with the computer on the command line.

The project primarily demonstrates principles and syntax of serialization and file-writing as a mechanism of saving, loading, and deleting program states.
